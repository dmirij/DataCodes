In 2018 climate scientist Ed Hawkins did what every scientist wants to do with data visualization. Following the old saying "a picture is worth more than a thousand words" he created the now famous Climate Stripes graphics. One look at the graphic and you truely do not need words. Here I have a little R code that produces the Climate Stripe graphics for Yerevan, Armenia - where I was born, using data from https://berkeleyearth.org/.
